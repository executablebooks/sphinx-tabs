## 2.0.0 - 2021-01-24

♻️ Refactor to reduce JS/CSS payload size and improve accesibility:

* Removed semantic-ui assets
* Removed unused 'sphinx_tabs_nowarn' sphinx option
* JS/CSS assets are now copied across by sphinx when builing, rather than being copied by the extension
* Changed tab HTML to use tab roles
* Changed tab label colour, to increase contrast with background
* Added ARIA labels for tabs and panels
* Added tabindex atributes to allow users to focus and switch tabs using a keyboard
* Added a margin below images inside tab content

✨ New features:

* Selecting an open tab now closes the tabs panel
* The last selected group tab persists between pages (if the browser supports session storage)

## 1.3.0 - 2020-09-08

♻️ Major refactor of tabs, group-tabs and code-tabs (thanks to [@foster999](https://github.com/foster999)):

* Removes hard-coded reStructuredText for group and code tabs, so that this works with other parsers (inc `MyST Markdown`)
* group-tab directive now subclasses `TabDirective` to remove duplicated run code
* likewise, `code-tab` now subclasses `group-tab`
* `TabDirective` and `TabsDirective` now subclass `SphinxDirective` for easier access to directive `env`

🧪 testing infrastructure has now fully moved from unittest to pytest

✨ New features:

* Can now pass `code-tabs` with a second argument (allowing whitespace) to provide an alternative tab label
* `code-tabs` can now use custom lexers, which are added to the sphinx app in `conf.py`
